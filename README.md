# Personal Website Project v2

As I've detailed in my most recent blogpost, I'm not satisifed with how the first iteration of my personal website
turned out. Its solutions are overkill and can be simplified greatly. I've chosen to redesign the entire application
in Astro. Astro is a MPA SSG framework that has some really neat features for content management and builds with tiny
bundle sizes. I can now add blogposts by simply committing to the repository. NOTE: I don't think there's anything
wrong with the technologies I was using in my previous iteration of this project. Retrospectively, they just weren't
the tools for the job.
